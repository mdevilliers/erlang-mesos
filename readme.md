erlang-mesos
------------

An erlang binding for [mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/).
Currently supports the 0.24.1 version - see [releases](https://github.com/mdevilliers/erlang-mesos/releases) for previous releases.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdevilliers/erlang-mesos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdevilliers/erlang-mesos)

How does it work
----------------

erlang-mesos has been implemented as a [nif](http://www.erlang.org/doc/tutorial/nif.html).
Messages are sent via the nif to mesos and mesos callbacks into erlang asynchronously. Although nifs are never ideal
the asynchronous implmentaion of mesos lends itself nicely in this case.

The modules - scheduler.erl and executor.erl are directly equivialant to their counterparts in mesos.
To add your own mesos scheduler or framework you implement the behaviours that they expose.

For example a basic scheduler would look like this - 

```
-behaviour (scheduler).

init(_) ->
    FrameworkInfo = #'FrameworkInfo'{user="", name="My Framework"},
    MasterLocation = "127.0.1.1:5050",
    State = [],
    {FrameworkInfo, MasterLocation, State}.

registered(FrameworkID, MasterInfo, State) -> {ok,State}.

reregistered(MasterInfo, State) -> {ok,State}.

resourceOffers(Offer, State) -> {ok,State}.

disconnected(State) -> {ok,State}.

offerRescinded(OfferID, State) -> {ok,State}.

statusUpdate(StatusUpdate, State) -> {ok,State}. 

frameworkMessage(ExecutorID, SlaveID, Message, State) -> {ok,State}.

slaveLost(SlaveID, State) -> {ok,State}.

executorLost(ExecutorID, SlaveID, Status, State)-> {ok,State}.

error(Message, State) -> {ok,State}.

```


There is an example framework (scheduler) and executor in the src directory.

There is also an example of using erlang-mesos in an OTP application at [merkxx](https://github.com/mdevilliers/merkxx).

Future
------

I want to move the implementation to use the low level wire protocol. As details emerge this api wrapper will
move away from the nif implementation to becoming a native erlang implementation. This will of course be 
"safer" in an erlang context

Getting started
---------------

[Install mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/gettingstarted/) 

The vagrant file I use for dev testing is at https://github.com/mdevilliers/vagrant-mesos-development-environment. It can be pointed at the version of mesos you wish to develop against plus installs erlang, gcc, git ect.

Install the protobuf tools.

```
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

```
git clone .....
cd erlang-mesos
```

Get the project dependancies

```
./rebar get-deps
```

Compile the application including the generated modules from the .proto file

```
./rebar compile
```

After that you should be all set with a 

```
./rebar compile skip_deps=true
```

To run the example framework from a command window

```
erl -pa ebin 
scheduler:start_link( example_framework, "127.0.1.1:5050").
```

Note this will only work on a single node (development) cluster due to the way the example executor is found.
This is only for convenience whilst developing.

Best Practice
-------------

erlang-mesos is a new library interfacing over a nif to a rapidly changing library so at least initally I would recommend running it in another erlang node.

Help
-----

To debug mesos you can use the following enviromental variable before starting up the erlang runtime.

```
GLOG_v=1 erl -pa ebin
```

Thanks
------

Special thanks goes to [mokele](https://github.com/mokele) for the acceptOffer implementation.

[mesos-go](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-go) was an extremely helpful examplar
